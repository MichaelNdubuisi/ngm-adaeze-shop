- [x] Update image URLs for development environment
- [x] Set up Cloudinary environment variables (using fallback for CLOUD_NAME)
- [x] Test Cloudinary connection (successful)

## Progress
- Analyzed current setup: Cloudinary partially integrated
- Confirmed plan with user
- Standardized folder name in uploadRoutes.js
- Created migration script and executed successfully
- Updated ProductCard.js to handle both Cloudinary and backend URLs
- Updated image URLs from production to development for local testing
- Created testCloudinary.js script to verify Cloudinary configuration
